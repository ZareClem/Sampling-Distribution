### Sampling-Distribution
In this project, I utilized the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) 2015-2016 dataset to compute the difference in mean systolic blood pressures between two samples. The aim was to mimic the "chance variation" that would occur if the NHANES project had the resources to sample only 100 participants for their study.

The project works by randomly sampling two subsets of size 100 from the NHANES dataset and calculating the difference in mean systolic blood pressure between the two subsets. This process is repeated 1000 times, allowing for an observation of the typical differences in mean systolic blood pressure between two samples of size 100 from the NHANES population.

The results of the project show that the typical difference in mean systolic blood pressure between two samples of size 100 from the NHANES population is around 2.8 mmHg. This means that if two researchers were to study the same population, but each only had the resources to sample 100 participants, it is likely that their results would differ from each other by around 2.8 mmHg due to chance variation.
